# Feature_importance_EnergyPlus

It is a resository for calculating feature importance of energy-saving factors in Plant Factories with Artificial Light (PFAL) using EnergyPlus.

Reference: Energy-saving effect assessment of various factors in container plant factories: A data-driven random forest approach (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cles.2024.100122)

Energy-saving factors: wall heat transfer coefficient, outer surface solar reflectivity, outer surface infrared emissivity, infiltration, orientation, air conditioner COP, light efficacy

Feature importance calculation method: random forest

Data source: EnergyPlus batch calculation file with Python API (https://eppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)
